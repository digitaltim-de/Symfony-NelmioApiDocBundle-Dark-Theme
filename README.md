## 🚀 Installation

Simply copy the `templates/` folder into your Symfony project:

```bash
./templates/
```

That’s it — the theme is now active.

---

## ⚙️ Development

If you want to customize the theme, the following scripts are available:

```bash
npm run build     # Build once
npm run watch     # Watch for changes during development
```

---

## 📦 Production

For production use, include only the minimized CSS file:

```bash
public/swagger-dark.min.css
```

You can link it in your custom NelmioApiDocBundle templates.
